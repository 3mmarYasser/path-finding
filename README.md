## Introduction

Welcome to the Path-Finding Visualizer! This project allows users to interactively visualize popular path-finding algorithms on a grid, helping them understand the workings of algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, DFS, and BFS.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid:** Visualize the algorithm in action on an interactive grid.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of path-finding algorithms, including Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, and DFS.
- **Real-time Metrics:** View real-time metrics like execution time and visited cells during the algorithm's run.
- **Adjustable Animation Speed:** Customize the animation speed to suit your preference.
- **Random Maze Generation:** Quickly generate random mazes to test the algorithms on complex scenarios.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on different devices with responsive design.
